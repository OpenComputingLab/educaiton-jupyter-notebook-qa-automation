TO DO

Notes on how we can get live support "automation" in Jupyter notebook and VS Code environments using extensions, eg spell-checkers, [previewing generated outputs](https://blog.ouseful.info/2021/11/02/previewing-sphinx-and-jupyter-book-rendered-mermaid-and-wavedrom-diagrams-in-vs-code/)

TO DO also need to set up earlier the idea that we can get support at different parts of the workflow, for example, in the editor, (informally, on the command line), when making local commits using pre-commit hooks, when checking into a repo using Github Actions etc.
