# GitHub Actions

[*GitHub Actions*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are automation scripts that can be configured to run in response to triggered events in online GitHub repositories.

A wide range of triggering events are available, including manual triggering, push and pull requests, releases, issue related events, and schedule based `cron` triggers.
