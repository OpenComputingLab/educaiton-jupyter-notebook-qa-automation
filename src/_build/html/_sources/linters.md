# Linters

*Linters* are quality tools that can check code or text for "correctness". For example, a code linter might perform a stati analysis of programming code to check that the code syntax is correct. Other, more advance linters, may also try to identufy simple bugs or contravention of coding guidelines in a code fragment. In text documents, tools such as spell-checkers might be though of as providing a "linting" style service.
