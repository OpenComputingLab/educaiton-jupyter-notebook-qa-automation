# Introduction

In many software development projects, automation tools are used to support code development quality processes.

For example, "formatting" tools are available that will enforce style rules in the layout of programming code and "linting" tools will perform static analysis of code to check it for syntactic correctness and identify simple errors.

Tools are also available for performing quality checks on more general texts, including formatters that can be applied to the underlying raw text or spell checkers that perform a "linting" role on the text content.
