# Notebook Quality Tools

TO DO

- review other `nbqa` tools not reviewed elsewhere herein;
- [`nb_quality_profile`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/nb_quality_profile/) examples (see also: [`notebook_profiler`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/nb_quality_profile/blob/master/notebook_profiler.ipynb)) and [other possibles](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/nb_quality_profile/issues);
- [`Isabel-Gan/quantifying-notebook-features`](https://github.com/Isabel-Gan/quantifying-notebook-features)

The [`srstevenson/nb-clean`](https://github.com/srstevenson/nb-clean) package also provides a command-line command (`nb-clean check`) for checking whether a notebook is clean or not. This could be used as part of workflow automation or checking to ensure that notebooks are cleaned as required.
